# SyncedPlay

This program was developed for people who need to play back certain sound files at certain times in a theatrical show. I found that other programs had too much lag from when you press play to when the sound effect actually plays, didn't allow me to play multiple sounds at once, and didn't allow me to loop sounds continuously (while playing other sounds). 

SyncedPlay is written in Python using PyGame, and it loads all the sound effects when the program starts, so they all able to be started instantaneously. Also it includes a loop command, so samples (like a cell phone ring) can be looped until they need to be stopped. The shows can be run live (by typing commands) or cued up in a cue file (each cue can be activated by pressing tab).
