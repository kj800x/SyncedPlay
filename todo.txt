Investigate the possiblity of an alias.txt
  Ex:
    sounds.txt:
      [sound.ogg]
      _name = Magic Sound
      _command = mag
    alias.txt:
      m-sil = silence mag
    Possible commands:
      silence mag
      fade 1 mag
      play mag
      loop mag
      m-sil
      
      
done:
Add in a loops option for ambiance looping sounds.
  Docs: http://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/mixer.html
    Search for loop
Investigate the possiblity of assiging each sound a base command, and then using modifications of that for each command
  Ex:
    sounds.txt:
      [sound.ogg]
      _name = Magic Sound
      _command = mag
    Possible commands:
      silence mag
      fade 1 mag
      play mag
      loop mag
