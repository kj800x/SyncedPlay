# SyncedPlay

This program was developed for people who need to play back certain sound files at certain times, with no delay.
My particular use-case was during drama preformances, when sound effects had to be played, and other solutions had too long of a loading period.

Because I've had a few non-programmer type people ask me if they can use this, I'm going to write some very simple instructions. More technically minded people might want to look at the file README_FOR_PROGRAMMERS.md.

## Steps to get started:

1.  Downloads the program. You'll find the download button on the github page (Currently: http://github.com/robodoggy/SyncedPlay ). It's at the bottom of the rightmost column on the page. Alternatively, google "Download ZIP file github.com"
2.  Extract the program.
3.  Open the file "index.html" in the docs folder.
4.  What are you still doing here? That file is where I continue my instructions.
