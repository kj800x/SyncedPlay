    <h1> Synced Play </h1>
      <p> HELLO ALL! </p>
      <h2> Install Instructions: </h2>
        <p> This program doesn't install quite like other programs. This program depends on a few programs to run, so you install those first. </p>
        <h3> Installing Python </h3>
          <p> Make sure you install the 2.7 version. </p>
          <h4> Windows Users: </h4>
            <p> You get it easier than the rest of them. You just need to go to <a href="http://python.org/download/">python.org</a> and install Python. Boom! Python is done! That was easy! </p>
            <p> One thing to note, keep track of where it installs it, because you might need that later. </p>
          <h4> Mac Users: </h4>
            <p> (Un)lucky, you guys have a little work to do. Apple tried to help you and already installed Python for you. Yay! ... But, they messed it up and it doesn't work with a bunch of things. Not Yay! </p>
            <p> You have to go and download a fresh version straight from <a href="http://python.org/download/">python.org</a> and install it anew. When you are installing it, pay attention to where you are installing it to. Make a note of that, because you <i>WILL</i> need it later!</p>
          <h4> Linux Users: </h4>
            <p> You guys chose the hard life, and I'm going to leave it up to you to figure out how to install python and py-game.</p>
            <p> I lied, your instructions are so easy: For Debian, Mint, Ubuntu or similars, try running "apt-get install python python-pygame". Then just run "python code.py" to run the program.
        <h3> Installing PyGame </h3>
          <h4> All Operating Systems: </h4>
            <p> Download from <a href="http://www.pygame.org/">pygame.org</a>. It's a really easy install. Make sure you get the download for Python 2.7.</p>
        <h3> Making the shortcut </h3>
          <h4> Windows </h4>
            <p> Go to the start menu and type in "notepad". </p>
            <p> Write the text: </p>
<pre>
python.exe code.py
</pre>
            <p> Click "Save As" </p>
            <p> Where it says "Save As Type" chose "All Files". Type in "run.bat" for the filename, and save it in the folder that you downloaded the program to. </p>
            <p> Double click the file to start the program </p>
            <p> If that doesn't work, delete the file you made, and do the steps over again, this time writing the text: </p>
<pre>
PLACEWHEREYOUINSTALLEDPYTHON\python.exe code.py
</pre>
            <p> Replace PLACEWHEREYOUINSTALLEDPYTHON with the actual place you installed python. That should work </p>
          <h4> Mac </h4>
            <p> Open up the Application "TextEdit" </p>
            <p> Write the text: </p>
<pre>
PLACEWHEREYOUINSTALLEDPYTHON/python code.py
</pre>
            <p> Click "Save As" </p>
            <p> Save it as "run.sh" in the folder that you downloaded my program to. <p>
            <p> Double click the file to start the program. </p>
        <h2> Using the program </h2>
          <p> I'm going to make a youtube for this. If you want, you can try and figure it out on your own. I'll put the link up if I remember to. Otherwise, remind me. </p>
